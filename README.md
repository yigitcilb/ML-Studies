# Learnings from Machine Learning Studies

I have been studying Andrew Ng's CS229 course. Inspired by the course, I have implemented and explored several fundamental machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms I Have Studied

- **Gradient Descent**  
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Regression Tree**  
- **Temporal Difference (TD)**  
- **Value Iteration**
